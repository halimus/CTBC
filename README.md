# Clock Tower Bell Counter - CTBC

### User Story
As a clock enthusiast, I want to know how many times a clock tower will ring its bell between two
given times so that I can plan to sing along.

### Background
A clock tower will ring its bell every hour, on the hour, a number of times equal to the number
indicated by the hours hand.

#### Example
At 3pm, the clock tower will ring the bell three times. At midnight, it will ring the bell 12 times.

### Technical Specification
Write a class with a method called "countBells" that will accept a start time and end time. Both
times will be in twenty-four hour notation, such as 12:00 for noon and 15:30 for half-past three in
the afternoon.

Your function should return a integer representing the number of times the clock tower will ring its
bell between the two provided times
