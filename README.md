# Clock Tower Bell Counter - CTBC

### User Story
As a clock enthusiast, I want to know how many times a clock tower will ring its bell between two
given times so that I can plan to sing along.

### Background
A clock tower will ring its bell every hour, on the hour, a number of times equal to the number
indicated by the hours hand.
